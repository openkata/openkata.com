**Introduction**

You're probably wondering what this is all about, I hear you! As someone who's been teaching software development and computer security topics, there's a lack of consistent, and effective tools at our disposal. That's quite a claim, but let's unpack this.

**Inconsistent Platform**

If you've been teaching on behalf of an educational institution or an organization, you'll quickly find out that every instructor has different tools at their disposal. That's not necessarily a bad thing, _having choices is a good thing_. It only becomes troublesome when it becomes an obstacle to your learners.

Example! Let's say an instructor wants to use _Oracle VirtualBox_ in the classroom because they're more comfortable with it, or are aware of a specific feature that will benefit the learners in the future. However, the learners might also be required to use _VMWare_ in another environment. _Why is this a problem?_ Well, your learner is going to be spending more time learning both tools, even though they both achieve a similar result.

Your ultimate goal is on the learning outcomes. We need to reduce the distractions and lab setup overhead to maximize our time teaching core concepts.

**Existing Tools are Fragmented**

There are _many tools that do many things_. This is an extension to the previous point with one important distinction. If you're leveraging different tools from various providers, you're probably paying for some sort of subscription for each subsequent service. There are many services that provide quizzes, voting, surveys and the list goes on.

Depending where you work, some of these tools might already be available without burning a hole in your own pocket. Not all instructors have this luxury, especially if it's volunteer effort.

**Larger Solutions are Cost Prohibitive**

The larger platforms _cost a lot of money_. If you're teaching a class of 100+ learners over several months, it could cost you more than a luxury sports car. This is especially true for providers that offer a greater set of functionality. The larger solutions are cost is prohibitive, plain and simple.

**Complexity Distractions**

A lot of time is spent setting up learning environments and installing dependencies rather than teaching targeted concepts. If I'm presenting a lecture on [programming reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) as an example, it shouldn't be derailed by an obscure issue on a learner's laptop.

**Conclusion**

What is Openkata? It's an initiative around developing open-source software to provide easy-to-use lab environments, tools and resources for educators and learners.
